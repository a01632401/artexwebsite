	 <div id="test4" "card-panel yellow darken-1"><h4>Get to know ARTEX</h4></div>
	 <div class="card-panel amber"></div>
	 <p> Artex is a service in  the form of an online platform that is intended to teach users art techniques based on their current skill level, interests and medium of choice, as well as introduce them to a community of users with the same goals; being able to do art. </p>

	 <p>We have observed that current services are not offering a personalized path for the user to learn techniques; it is often a unilateral channel that does not leave room for the artist to receive feedback from other artists. Popular platforms intended for blogging have become hosts of artists’ portfolios and work and formed communities, yet an alternative that is exclusively dedicated to learning art with the help of a community and resources specifically chosen to fit your needs is still non-existent.</p>

	 <p>We believe that by focusing on the users’ needs and expectations, we can contribute with the following benefits for the user: </p>
	 &nbsp;<p style="text-indent :5em;">Improved skill levels in the artistic discipline of choice</t></p>
	 &nbsp;<p style="text-indent :5em;">A better understanding of artistic processes</p>
	 &nbsp;<p style="text-indent :5em;">Theoretical context for the material they’re reviewing</p>
	 &nbsp;<p style="text-indent :5em;">An interactive community of artists </p>
	 &nbsp;<p style="text-indent :5em;">More interest from the community in art </p>

	 <div class="card-panel amber"><h5> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OUR USERS</h5></div>
	 <p> We offer guidance to anyone who is interested in art, be it a beginner who wants to learn to draw basic figures to any semi-professional artist that wants to improve areas of their work. The user is not restricted by age, since we believe that the platform should be accessible to anyone and easy to interact with.</p>
	 <div><h5>Where does our product fit in their work or life?</h5></div>
	 <p> Our service can relate to our users’ lives as a hobby, or as a tool to develop their work and make a career out of it. We seek to inspire people to pursue their interests in art, despite the level of ‘compromise’ they’re willing to give.</p>
	 <div><h5>What problems does our product solve?</h5></div>
	 <p> Our product simplifies the process of locating art resources online, offers a channel for artists in progress to discuss and communicate with other more experienced artists, and finally, tracks the process of improvement of our users.  </p>
	 <div><h5>When and how is our product used?</h5></div>
	 <p>Our service can be used at any time the user needs to, and lessons and exercise will be divided by the time they take so that the user can select accordingly to the time that they have in the moment of use.</p>
